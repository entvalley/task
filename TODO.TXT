By default an author has full access to an entity he or she creates.

The author of a project can invite other people to that project.

Those people can add new entitis within a project and have access to objects that they create.

The author of a project can change any data within his project. We can use the relation table to store levels of access
for every person including authors instead of relying on authors in the future.


SHARED OBJECTS.

Sometimes two users may have access to the same object, if the owner let them share it.
 We need to link an object to two users (or at least one, because one of them is the owner of an object).

 We purpose use acl for that?
